      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every town has their stories of how they were created and developed over the years.&#xA;In my hometown of Litchfield, New Hampshire, I had the opportunity to re-discover that history and&#xA;create historical plaques about it for visitors to see.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The project consisted of five pages, or plaques, spread through the trail loop slowly explaining the&#xA;historical significance of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/maps/place/Moore%27s&amp;#43;Falls&amp;#43;Conservation&amp;#43;Area/@42.889804,-71.4576986,802m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x89e24cbf7350056d:0xed373f3adc07f897!8m2!3d42.8898001!4d-71.4551237!16s%2Fg%2F11c528d249?entry=ttu&amp;amp;g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDIwNC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D&#34;&gt;Moore&amp;rsquo;s Falls Trail&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;over the course of the hike.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This project consisted of several factors. Funding for the project needed to be secured via work with local businesses and the local newspaper.&#xA;Stakeholders needed updates on the project and proof of work to approve the necessary steps. The most notable stakeholder was&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/litchfieldnhconservationcommission/&#34;&gt;The Litchfield Conservation Commission&lt;/a&gt;, a governmental board of the town&#xA;responsible for the trails and the group that originally requested the project. Finally, it required organizing and leading a team of&#xA;scouts in building and setting the plaques across the trail.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
