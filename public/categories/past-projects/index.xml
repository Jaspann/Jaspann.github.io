      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Allowing VTubers to express themselves though emotion hotkeys.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;finding-vtubing-and-3tene&#34;&gt;Finding VTubing and 3tene&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once the coronavirus pandemic hit and society was in lock down, I started watching more Twitch.&#xA;Around this time was when VTubers were taking off, as people could remain semi-anonymous online while&#xA;attempting to grow a following on video based platforms. The concept was in good fun and not too serious&#xA;as you would expect from a mildly popular casual entertainment genre. This was my fist look at human&#xA;positional tracking systems, and I came to the conclusion that while the underlying technology was good,&#xA;some key features I would expect seemed to be missing from apps for people to use this seriously.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My First Large Project: an Arcade Game for Smart Phones.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Looking back at how I first learned software development, I feel very fortunate to have taken the path I did.&#xA;In my junior year of high school I took &lt;a href=&#34;https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-a&#34;&gt;AP Computer Science A&lt;/a&gt;,&#xA;which was taught extremely thoroughly on &lt;a href=&#34;https://vlacs.org/&#34;&gt;VLACS&lt;/a&gt; and&#xA;is probably the best course I took in high school despite it being online. My senior year I needed to do a senior&#xA;project, and for this, I decided to re-implement an idea I had made previously, reimagining it using &lt;a href=&#34;https://unity.com/&#34;&gt;Unity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
