      <description>&lt;p&gt;Allowing VTubers to express themselves though emote hotkeys.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;finding-vtubing-and-3tene&#34;&gt;Finding VTubing and 3tene&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once the coronavirus pandemic hit and society was in lock down, I started watching more Twitch.&#xA;Around this time was when VTubers were taking off, as people could remain semi-anonymous online while&#xA;attempting to grow a following on video based platforms. The concept was in good fun and not too serious&#xA;as you would expect from a mildly popular casual entertainment genre. This was my fist look at human&#xA;positional tracking systems, and I came to the conclusion that while the underlying technology was good,&#xA;some key features I would expect seemed to be missing from apps for people to use this seriously.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
