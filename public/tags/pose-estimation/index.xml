      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Flutter library for pose detection using Google&amp;rsquo;s Mediapipe.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Before 2023, Google&amp;rsquo;s solution for machine learning (ML) on mobile was&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/&#34;&gt;ML Kit&lt;/a&gt;. The library was for Android and iOS&#xA;and had a variety of small models to perform common tasks that developers could use for&#xA;their apps. This was before LLMs took over the public mind, so the platform heavily focused&#xA;on computer vision for tasks like facial detection and image labeling.&#xA;The library was well received by many developers and the developer community was even&#xA;interested enough in the library that it was ported to Flutter for&#xA;iOS and Android as &lt;a href=&#34;https://pub.dev/packages/google_ml_kit&#34;&gt;google_ml_kit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Allowing VTubers to express themselves through global hotkeys.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;finding-vtubing-and-3tene&#34;&gt;Finding VTubing and 3tene&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once the coronavirus pandemic hit and society was in lockdown, I started watching more Twitch.&#xA;Around this time, VTubing was taking off, as people could remain semi-anonymous online while&#xA;attempting to grow a following on video-based platforms. The concept was in good fun and not too serious&#xA;as you would expect from a mildly popular casual entertainment genre. This was my first look at human&#xA;positional tracking systems, and I was impressed with the underlying technology. The problem often was in&#xA;the feature set of the applications used for this growing genre of entertainment, where key features I&#xA;would expect to find in popularly recommended apps seemed to be missing for the technology to&#xA;be used more seriously.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
