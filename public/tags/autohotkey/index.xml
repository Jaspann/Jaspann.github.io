      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Allowing VTubers to express themselves through global hotkeys.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;finding-vtubing-and-3tene&#34;&gt;Finding VTubing and 3tene&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once the coronavirus pandemic hit and society was in lockdown, I started watching more Twitch.&#xA;Around this time, VTubing was taking off, as people could remain semi-anonymous online while&#xA;attempting to grow a following on video-based platforms. The concept was in good fun and not too serious&#xA;as you would expect from a mildly popular casual entertainment genre. This was my first look at human&#xA;positional tracking systems, and I was impressed with the underlying technology. The problem often was in&#xA;the feature set of the applications used for this growing genre of entertainment, where key features I&#xA;would expect to find in popularly recommended apps seemed to be missing for the technology to&#xA;be used more seriously.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
