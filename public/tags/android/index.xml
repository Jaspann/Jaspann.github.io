      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing a Flutter library with full BLE peripheral capabilities for iOS and Android&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;bluetooth-for-freemovevr&#34;&gt;Bluetooth For FreeMoveVR&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Early on in the creation of FreeMoveVR, I knew I wanted the primary communication&#xA;method between the smartphone and computer to be over Bluetooth. I believed that&#xA;Bluetooth was the perfect solution for our use case because:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Everyone has Bluetooth on their phone, and it is a stable option for developers.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;FreeMoveVR needs to transfer a relatively small amount of data compared to something like streaming music to AirPods.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s wireless, so there is less hassle setting up the program for the end user.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It does not rely on Wi-Fi at all, which is good in cases like colleges where the protocols are very complex and locked down for students.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;BLE stands for Bluetooth Low Energy, so the implication is that the phone can do the main task of pose detection and spend minimal resources on data transfer.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The most notable arguments against the other methods were that a wired connection would be hard to use given how the app works,&#xA;and that a Wi-Fi connection would be impossible to develop while on campus at SNHU.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
