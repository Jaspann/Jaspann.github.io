      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Using Machine Learning to Find the Chance a Flight is on Time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I had recently returned to San Jose after visiting my family across the country.&#xA;While waiting at Logan Airport in Boston, I was watching the snowfall and wondered&#xA;if it would delay my flight. It had just started and light snow is a normal occurrence for&#xA;the area, so it was unlikely but possible. I then considered San Jose&amp;rsquo;s Airport. While they have&#xA;different weather they need to account for, there is no infrastructure in place for even&#xA;light snow. In addition, many drivers would not know how to handle slippery roads, which&#xA;would probably cause significant problems across the city.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
