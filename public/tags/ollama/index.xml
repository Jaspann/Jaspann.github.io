      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fine-tuning Llama for sheet music generation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently reached a critical mass in the public eye,&#xA;where everyone is trying to apply the technology to any problem they can think of.&#xA;They have been further trained, or fine-tuned, for a variety of use cases, be it for&#xA;business, software development, or speaking languages outside their original training&#xA;data. At the time, I had recently learned about &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.w3.org/2021/06/musicxml40/&#34;&gt;MusicXML&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;which is the format used for sheet music. An application like &lt;a href=&#34;https://musescore.org/en&#34;&gt;MuseScore&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;is used to write music sheets for musicians and saves the work to a &lt;code&gt;.MXL&lt;/code&gt; file so it can be&#xA;redistributed and edited without the pains of using a proprietary file type or making&#xA;the sheets by hand and scanning them with a printer. MusicXML has been a standard since 2004&#xA;and managed by W3C by 2015. As it is a pretty widely accepted standard, we looked into&#xA;understanding how an LLM like Llama could be fine-tuned on this data to continue existing music&#xA;or generate its own.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Applying LLM routing for a single chat across multiple repositories.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many of the projects I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on combine multiple repositories to create a single experience&#xA;for the user. There are many common examples of this, like a full-stack developer working on&#xA;the front and back end. It gets much more complex though as the scope of the application grows. Companies&#xA;may want development teams for Android and iOS, and this requires teams to understand where each&#xA;other team is at to maintain feature parity. There are many questions that a developer of one team&#xA;could have, and discussion on every technical intricacy can take time from development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
