      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By my senior year in high school, I had nearly complete freedom to do what I wanted,&lt;/em&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;so I chose to help teach programming to my friends.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most people can probably agree that high school can be as easy as you want it to be.&#xA;In my school, I needed a total of 24 credits. There were eight class slots per year.&#xA;One of those slots was often taken up by a free block, so the average student often&#xA;would gain seven a semester. Even if you complexly fail a class every semester,&#xA;you would still have six credits a year, multiplied by four years will give you the&#xA;24 credits needed to graduate. If you do well in school, you could easily skip the&#xA;free block and have eight credits a year, which means you would be theoretically able&#xA;to graduate a whole year early. Anyone that was that smart though would spend time&#xA;working on AP classes to get a head start in college.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
