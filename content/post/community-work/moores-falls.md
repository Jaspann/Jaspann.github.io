Every town has their stories of how they were created and developed over the years. 
In my hometown of Litchfield, New Hampshire, I had the opportunity to re-discover that history and
create write about it for visitors to see.

The project consisted of five pages, or plaques, spread through the trail loop slowly explaining the 
historical significance of the [Moore's Falls Trail](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Moore's+Falls+Conservation+Area/@42.889804,-71.4576986,802m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x89e24cbf7350056d:0xed373f3adc07f897!8m2!3d42.8898001!4d-71.4551237!16s%2Fg%2F11c528d249?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDIwNC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) 
over the course of the hike. 

This project consisted of several factors. Funding for the project needed to be secured via work with local businesses and the local news paper. 
Stakeholders needed updates on the project and proof of work to approve the necessary steps. The most notable stakeholder being the 
[Litchfield Conservation Commission](https://www.facebook.com/litchfieldnhconservationcommission/), a governmental board of the town
responsible for the trails and the group that originally requested the project. Finally it required organizing and leading a team of 
scouts in building and setting the plaques across the trail. 

In retrospect, the original writings were a bit long considering the length of the trail, but it was a culmination of 
research between multiple town historians, including Chuck Mower, The book [The Incredible Ditch: A Bicentennial History of the Middlesex Canal](https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Incredible_Ditch/DmGCsEpGExQC) and most notably [The Middlesex Canal Association](http://www.middlesexcanal.org/), 
a historical group and museum dedicated to preserving the history of the canal system on the Merrimack River. 

Additionally, I would like to thank [BSA Troop 11](https://lccpnh.org/scouts-bsa/), as the project would not have been possible without them.
