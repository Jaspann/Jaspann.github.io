Every town has their stories of how they were created and developed over the years. 
In my hometown of Litchfield, New Hampshire, I had the opportunity to re-discover that history and
create write about it for visitors to see.

The project consisted of five pages, or plaques, spread through the trail loop slowly explaining the 
historical significance of the [Moore's Falls Trail](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Moore's+Falls+Conservation+Area/@42.889804,-71.4576986,802m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x89e24cbf7350056d:0xed373f3adc07f897!8m2!3d42.8898001!4d-71.4551237!16s%2Fg%2F11c528d249?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDIwNC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) 
over the course of the hike. In retrospect, the 
original writings were a bit long considering the length of the trail, but it was a culmination of 
research between multiple town historians, including Chuck Mower, The book [The Incredible Ditch: A Bicentennial History of the Middlesex Canal](https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Incredible_Ditch/DmGCsEpGExQC) and most notably [The Middlesex Canal Association](http://www.middlesexcanal.org/), 
a historical group and museum dedicated to preserving the history of the canal system on the Merrimack River. 

> While on most of the other pages I plan to dedicate to software development, 
I wanted to include this page as a digital record of the work I did for the town.
