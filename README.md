The intention of this site is to provide a place where I can record the past projects I worked on.
It's meant to be somewhere between a portfolio and a retrospective blog, where I discuss what I 
worked on from a technical perspective and show off the design process behind the features that were added.

The date of the post the approximate date I finished the project, not the date of writing.
